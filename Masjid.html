	<p>aj-ul-Masajid is a mosque situated in Bhopal, India. The name is also spelt as Taj-ul-Masjid. However the correct name is Taj-ul-Masajid and not Taj-ul-Masjid.[citation needed] "Masajid" means "mosques" (Plural of "masjid") and "Taj-ul-Masajid" literally means "Crown Among Mosques". It is the largest mosque in India and one of the largest mosques in Asia's.</p>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>The construction of the Mosque was initiated during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum (1844–1860 and 1868–1901) of Bhopal (Wife of Baqi Mohammad Khan) and continued to be built by her daughter Sultan Jahan Begum, till her lifetime. The mosque was not completed due to lack of funds, and after a long lay-off after the War of 1857, construction was resumed in 1971 by great efforts of Allama Mohammad Imran Khan Nadwi Azhari and Maulana Sayed Hashmat Ali Sahab of Bhopal. The construction was completed by 1985 and the entrance (eastern) gate was renovated grandly using ancient motifs from circa 1250 Syrian mosques by the contribution of the Emir of Kuwait to commemorate the memory of his departed wife.</p>
